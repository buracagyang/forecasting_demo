# forecasting_demo
In this repository, a number of machine learning based forecasting models are implemented using Python and scikit-learn. This is just a demonstration of some forecasting projects.

# Envs

+ `Python 3.5` | `Windows 10`



# Requirements

+ `xgboost`==0.90
+ `scikit-learn`==0.21.1
+ `PyYAML`==5.1.1
+ `pandas`==0.24.1
+ `numpy`==1.15.1
+ `matplotlib`==3.0.2



# Getting started, example

Here is a simple example showing how you can run this a forecasting algorithm on default dataset

```python
python test_forecast_effect.py --model XGBOOST  # you can add more hyperparameters
```
